[Stutters or other issues on HEDT system after enabling 4G decoding]

This can happen when the allocated BAR address of the GPU is higher than recommended. 
Set MMIOH Base to 256GB or the closest value above that you system supports (eg 1TB), you can try higher if you need to due to installed RAM amount. 
This can also fix boot issues with macOS.


[System won't boot with large VRAM (>16GB) or multi-GPU]

On HEDT such as X99 increase MMIOH Size, this is found in IntelRCSetup if your BIOS doesn't expose the menu. 
On Ivy Bridge or Haswell you can try using less than 30GB of RAM, this should allow 16GB BAR to function. 
On Skylake with >32GB BAR you need to manually patch the BIOS AddMemorySpace call using a disassembler (only do if you know about this stuff)
 because there is currently no patch for it.
